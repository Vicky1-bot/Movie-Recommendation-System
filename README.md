# Description:

Recommendation Systems are everywhere from Youtube recommending similar videos, from Netflix recommending similar movies to Spotify recommending songs according to our interests. In short a recommendation system is an algorithm focussed at suggesting relevant recommendations to a user based on past preferences of the user or suggesting relevant data to the user based on the itemâ€™s features. There are two paradigms of recommender systems: Collaborative and Content Based methods. I created this recommendation system using Content based method. I used the details of the movie like cast and crew, genres, overview of the movie to predict the recommendations for the user.

# Project File Description:

1.'Movie data_new1.xlsx' is the main dataset used for building the recommendation system.
2.'Movie_recommendation.ipynb' files consist of data cleaning and data modification process performing on the various datasets.
3.'app.py' file consists of all the functions required for building the recommendation system and  also a demo of the working prototype of the project.
4.'movie_list1.pkl and similarity1.pkl' ,both are trained models of recommendation engine system.
